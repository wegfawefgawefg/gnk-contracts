# Contract Risk-Reward Analysis

## 1 G&K Perspective (Internal View)

| Area | Positives for G&K | Potential Gaps / Residual Risk |
|------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Payment Terms** | • 100 % (or 50/50) up-front → strong cash flow.<br>• Late-fee clause discourages delays. | • If you later allow milestone or hourly billing, MSA needs amendment or disputes may arise. |
| **IP Ownership** | • Retains _Background IP_ and archival copy.<br>• Optional addendum for broader reuse. | • Clause 5.3 still requires consent to reuse _Project IP_; may hinder later productization of bespoke code. |
| **Liability Cap** | • Capped at fees paid; excludes consequential damages. | • Larger enterprises may demand a higher cap (e.g., 2 × fees) or exclusions for data breaches. |
| **Termination** | • 14-day convenience exit lets you drop problematic clients.<br>• Paid work to date remains billable. | • If client terminates early and paid 100 % up-front, clarity needed: does unused portion get refunded or deemed earned pro-rata? |
| **Publicity Rights** | • Can name-drop clients for sales unless they opt out. | • Some Fortune 500 clients require prior written approval; have fallback language ready. |
| **Tax Handling** | • You absorb any Hawaii GET; removes friction in sales. | • Ensure accounting actually files/remits GET; non-compliance penalties fall on you. |
| **Dispute Forum** | • Texas arbitration = home-court advantage for Gibson. | • Remote clients may push for neutral or virtual venue; be prepared to negotiate. |
| **Progress Cadence** | • Monthly updates keep overhead low. | • For time-critical work, longer feedback loops may increase re-work; consider optional weekly cadence in SOW when needed. |

## 2 Client Perspective (External View)

| Client Concern | Why It Might Feel Risky | Mitigation / Compromise Options |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **100 % Up-Front Payment** | Pays before seeing results; bears delivery risk. | Offer 50 % up-front / 25 % midway / 25 % on acceptance, or escrow funds. |
| **10-Day Acceptance Window** | Busy teams could “miss the window” and be stuck with defects. | Extend to 20 business days or tie acceptance per-deliverable; include bug-fix grace period. |
| **Reuse of Code** | Fear proprietary logic reused for competitors. | Clarify carve-out: only generic utilities reused; offer “no-reuse” option (may raise fee). |
| **Liability Cap = Fees Paid** | Downstream losses could exceed fee amount. | Offer higher cap or supply professional-liability insurance certificate for regulated sectors. |
| **Arbitration in Texas** | Travel costs, perceived home-court bias. | Provide virtual arbitration option or “mutually agreed venue.” |
| **Change-Order Language** | Vague definition of “material change.” | Add examples (new integration, >15 % scope change) and require written quote + approval before billing extra. |
| **Monthly Updates Only** | May feel infrequent for agile/startup clients. | Include optional weekly Slack demos or Git repo access for real-time visibility. |
| **Limited Warranty** | Only workmanship warranty; no post-delivery support guaranteed. | Offer 30-day defect-remediation period at no extra charge, or optional maintenance add-on. |

### Overall Takeaway
*The draft is balanced for a small consultancy:* G&K’s cash-flow and liability positions are protected while staying within typical custom-software norms. Biggest negotiation flashpoints: **payment schedule, liability cap, IP reuse rights, and governing-law venue**. Prepare fallback clauses for enterprise prospects and confirm tax compliance with an attorney.
