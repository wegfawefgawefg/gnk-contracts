analyze from the perspective of G&K, and then from the perspective of a client, and see if it seems reasonable, what presumed risks or concerns might be present for a party.

Quick sanity-check of the draft
1. G&K’s vantage point — does it protect you?
Area	Good	Potential Gaps / Risks
Payment	• 100 % (or 50/50) up-front → strong cash-flow position.
• Late-fee clause.	• If you ever agree to milestone or hourly billing, MSA must be amended; otherwise client might push back.
IP	• Retains “Background IP” + archival copy.
• Optional addendum lets you re-use generic bits.	• “Reuse outside project requires client consent” (5.3) still forces a negotiation. If you want blanket right to reuse non-confidential portions, widen the carve-out now.
Liability cap	• Capped at fees paid; no consequential damages → industry norm.	• Some clients (esp. bigger enterprises) may insist on higher cap (e.g., 2× fees) or carve-outs for data-breach. Prep fallback language.
Termination	• 14-day convenience exit; work already delivered is billable.	• If client terminates early, clarity needed on whether unperformed portion of prepaid fee is refundable or deemed earned pro-rata.
Confidentiality / Publicity	• You can name-drop client unless they opt out.	• Some F500 clients require prior written approval for any publicity; keep an alternate NDA ready.
Tax	• Hawaii GET absorbed by you → keeps sales friction low.	• Be sure accounting actually books and remits GET if it applies; failure = penalties you must eat.
Dispute forum	• Texas arbitration— convenient for Gibson, not for Hawaii or remote clients.	• Some clients insist on their own state law or waive arbitration; be ready to compromise.
Schedule / updates	• Monthly written updates keep overhead low.	• For highly time-sensitive work you lose ability to course-correct quickly; consider optional weekly sync if project is <1 month.
2. Client’s vantage point — is it fair?
Concern	Why it could feel risky	Mitigations / tweaks you could offer
100 % up-front	They shoulder all payment risk; fear of non-delivery.	Offer 50 % up front, 25 % midway, 25 % on acceptance for larger deals. Escrow or milestone invoices help build trust.
Acceptance deemed after 10 days	Busy clients might “miss the window” and be stuck with defects.	Say “deemed accepted unless material issues reported within 20 business days” or allow acceptance per-deliverable not whole SOW.
IP carve-outs & reuse	Fear their competitive logic could be re-used for another customer.	Clarify that only generic utilities are reused; anything business-specific remains theirs. Offer optional “no-reuse” checkbox (may add fee premium).
Liability capped to fees	If your code causes large downstream loss, cap may look too low.	For regulated industries, offer higher cap or professional-liability insurance certificate.
Arbitration in Texas	Travel costs + perception of home-court bias.	Offer remote/virtual hearings or “mutually agreed location.”
Change-order language	Vague on what constitutes “material.” Worry about scope creep fees.	Add examples (feature X, new integration, >15 % schedule shift) and state that any increase in fees must be quoted and signed before work begins.
Progress visibility (monthly)	Might feel sparse for startups iterating weekly.	Point them to optional weekly Slack demos or repo access.
No warranties beyond workmanship	They might expect bug-fix period post-delivery.	Add a 30-day “defect remediation at no extra charge” window to ease minds.
3. Overall reasonableness

    Balanced for a small consultancy – Caps, IP terms, and up-front pay favor G&K but remain within SaaS/contract-dev norms.

    Most negotiable points you’ll get push-back on: payment schedule, liability cap, reuse rights, governing law.

    Safe for a client that trusts you – Provided you’re willing to tweak SOW payment milestones and add a bug-fix warranty, most sophisticated clients will sign.

No glaring red flags, but be ready with fallback clauses for enterprise prospects and double-check the GET/tax handling with an attorney.
