need to write contracts for the G&K software consultancy.

consultancy is cofounded by Gibson Martin and Kyle Dougan
Base of operations in Houston, Texas, LLC, 
Kyle is in hawaii, so theres some nexus rules there.

we need some standard work contracts for A amount of money and T time.
we can change those amounts and time for each client, so lets just do a 3 month contract as our template.

ownership of all work done will be granted to the client as is 
idk if we need to sign off on that, or if payment is afterwards.

kyle has stated he prefers to be paid up front.

idk what sort of guarantees we should offer to the clients
i have no experience with this so. whats standard etc. 
obviously we need to protect ourselves since say some clients are bad actors,

some clients will be code fluent and are allowed access to the code but wont own it until contract is signed off
some clients will not be code fluent and will not have access until sign off (idk how to protect client. 
if they paid up front obviously they dont own it as is right? or if they paid up front maybe they do own it as is?)
idk maybe its just simpler to have a sign over part

g&k is allowed to keep a copy of the code and reuse parts of it.
(i think in most cases this wont cause problems. maybe an optional part about only parts not unique to the business?
but we should still keep copy.)
or maybe this is just another paper we can have them sign also, that we get to keep all of it, or a 
different paper where we do a blacklist, specifying parts that wont be owned by gnk then both parties can agree

what papers should we make?
what other unique clauses will we need? i really dont know much about contracts.

obviously this will end up in a pdf with sign spots and logos, but for now can just be text. sort of markdown lite.

obviously a lawyer will vet this stuff after we write it
